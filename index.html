            <p> 1) By presenting the top 10 video games of all time (measured by total global sales) and the top publisher for each game genre 
                (measured by total times published) in bar graphs, the user can immediately determine which one is the "top" by looking at the longest
                bar (and the count next to it). Additionally, these graphs give a sense of the top 10 for each question, to provide some comparison metrics. 
                Additionally, the popularity of a genre, measured by genre sales per region, is displayed in a piechart so that the user can determine which
                genre represents the biggest pie, the total sales of that genre in the selected region, and what percentage of total sales does that genre
                represent.
            <br/>
            <br/>
            2) * I believe D3 is helpful in providing tools to make interactive visually-appealing graphs, especially for the ending results of
            a project. 
            <br/> 
            * Moreover, D3's great variety of charts and explanation of the best scenarios to choose a graph depending on what you want to show 
            (for example, correlation or ranking) makes it very easy to display data in an appealing and effective way. 
            <br/>
            * Lastly, the support code for each graph, found in the D3 Graph Gallery, was very useful for understanding how to best code the graph
            to fit my data.
            <br/> 
            <br/>
            3) * Sometimes D3 might not be the best tool for creating a visualization because it may not be the most effective in the given scenario.
            For example, for a graph that doesn't necessarily need to look super appealing, it might be more effective and quick to use Matplotlib.<br/>
            * Additionally, before starting the data analysis, it might be useful to do data visualization to explore the properties of the data. 
            In this scenario, D3 may not be the best tool but rather something quicker and simpler like either Excel or Matplotlib. <br/>
            * Following a similar logic as in the point above, D3 would also not be the most efficient tool for when periodically doing data visualization 
            throughout the analysis part of a project to checking for the quantitative trends, as it may take more time than using other tools.

            4)
            Users without visual impairments will find this dashboard more accessible than users with visual impairments. For example, I added the labels of
            my piechart in a hovering function and, unfortunately, someone that needs a screen reader will not be able to find these labels. Moreover, users
            with Protanopia and Deuteranopia will see the shades of blue as different shades of purple, but with the colors I chose, they will be able to see
            a difference in the shades, which is very important for the piechart. Someone with Achromatopsia will look at everything in my dashboard as
            different shades of grey, which can make my piechart less accessible for them. My color palette works well for people with Protanomaly, Deuteranomaly,
            Tritanomaly, and Achromatomaly. <br/>
            To deal with the different visual disparities, I created a stroke
            to separate each piece of the pie, and all my graphs have titles that describe the purpose of the graph and have labels whenever applicable. 
            The bar graphs are the most accessible because the difference in shades is irrelevant for the graph purposes. <br/>
            Additional actions to make my graph more accesible would be to eliminate the hover function (added to meet project requirements), but set static 
            labels with a clear line to reference the pie piece it corresponds to. Moreover, I would add alt text to my visuals. <br/> 
            * The color analysis was done by applying the "color blindness" feature to my color palette on Coolors.
            <br/> 
            <br/>
            5) 
            I first wanted to use a purple and blue color palette for my visualization, but thanks to the readings, I realized that such color palette would 
            make my dashboard inaccessible for many users. I tried playing with many color palettes in Coolors until I found one that would both be visually appealing and 
            minimize inaccessibility. I found this to be very challenging. I still don't think it's perfect, as some users would still find difficulties with the colors, so there is room for improvement
            in the color palette. What kept me from continuing this process was the time constraint. <br/>
            Additionally, and probably the most important, adding labels to my piechart through a hovering function makes my piechart largely inaccessible. I was
            mindful of this when creating the dashboard, but designed it this way to meet the tooltip requirement.
